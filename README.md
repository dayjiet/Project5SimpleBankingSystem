## Description
This is a simple banking system project implemented in Java. The project aims to provide a basic understanding of how a banking system works, along with practical experience in working with databases and SQL. It also introduces fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) through the use of classes.

## Features
The Simple Banking System offers the following features:

1. Account Creation: Users can create a new account, which includes generating a unique card number and PIN.
2. Account Login: Users can log into their existing accounts using their card number and PIN.
3. Balance Inquiry: Logged-in users can check their account balance.
4. Income Addition: Logged-in users can add income to their account.
5. Fund Transfer: Logged-in users can transfer funds from their account to another account.
6. Account Closure: Logged-in users can close their account.

## Usage
To run the Simple Banking System project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the database: The project uses an SQLite database. Ensure that the SQLite JDBC driver is installed.
2. Download the project files: Obtain the project files from the provided link.
3. Compile the project: Compile the Java classes using a Java compiler.
4. Run the project: Execute the compiled Main class, providing the optional command-line argument -fileName to specify the database file name. If no file name is provided, the default file name will be used.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions: The program will display a menu with different options. Enter the corresponding number to perform the desired action.

## Feedback
During this project, I learned about the functioning of a banking system and gained knowledge about SQL and databases. Understanding how the Luhn algorithm works was particularly valuable in preventing errors when entering card numbers. Additionally, I grasped basic object-oriented programming concepts, such as working with classes.

While working on the project, I encountered a few difficulties. Setting up and connecting to the database required some effort, but I was able to overcome it by studying the documentation and seeking guidance from online resources. Designing the system to handle various banking operations and ensuring data security also posed challenges, but careful planning and research helped me overcome these obstacles.

Overall, this project provided me with a practical understanding of banking systems and allowed me to develop my skills in working with databases, SQL, and object-oriented programming. It was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my knowledge and problem-solving abilities.
